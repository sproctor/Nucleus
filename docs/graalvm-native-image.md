# GraalVM Native Image

!!! danger "Experimental — for advanced developers only"
    GraalVM Native Image compilation for Compose Desktop is **highly experimental**. If reflection is not fully resolved at build time, the application **will crash at runtime**. This mode requires significant effort to configure and debug. Proceed only if you are comfortable with native-image internals.

## Why Native Image?

For most Compose Desktop applications, [AOT Cache (Leyden)](runtime/aot-cache.md) is the recommended way to improve startup. It's simple to set up and provides a major boost. But there are cases where even Leyden isn't enough:

- **Background services / system tray apps** — a lightweight app that mostly sits idle in the background will consume **300–400 MB of RAM** on a JVM, versus **100–150 MB** as a native image. For an app that's always running, this matters.
- **Instant-launch expectations** — Leyden brings cold boot down to ~1.5 s, but a native image starts in ~0.5 s. For utilities, launchers, or CLI-like tools where every millisecond counts, native image is the way to go.
- **Bundle size** — no bundled JRE means a much smaller distributable.

GraalVM Native Image compiles your entire application **ahead of time** into a standalone native binary that feels truly native to the OS.

### Trade-offs

Native image is not a free lunch. In addition to significantly more complex configuration (reflection, see below), there is a real **CPU throughput penalty**: the JVM's JIT compiler optimizes hot loops and polymorphic calls at runtime far better than AOT compilation can. For CPU-intensive workloads (heavy computation, real-time rendering, large data processing), a JVM with Leyden AOT cache will outperform a native image in sustained throughput.

| | JVM + Leyden | Native Image |
|---|---|---|
| Cold boot | ~1.5 s | ~0.5 s |
| RAM (idle) | 300–400 MB | 100–150 MB |
| CPU throughput | Excellent (JIT) | Lower (no JIT) |
| Bundle size | Larger (includes JRE) | Smaller |
| Configuration | Simple (`enableAotCache = true`) | Complex (reflection metadata) |
| Stability | Stable | Experimental |

**Choose native image when** startup speed and memory footprint are critical and CPU throughput is secondary. **Choose Leyden when** you want the best balance of performance, simplicity, and stability.

## Requirements

### BellSoft Liberica NIK 25 (Full)

GraalVM Native Image compilation **requires [BellSoft Liberica NIK 25](https://bell-sw.com/liberica-native-image-kit/)** (full distribution, not lite). This is the only supported distribution — standard GraalVM CE does not include the AWT/Swing support needed for desktop GUI applications.

!!! failure "Will not work with other distributions"
    Using Oracle GraalVM, GraalVM CE, or Liberica NIK Lite will fail. Desktop GUI applications require the **full** Liberica NIK distribution which includes AWT and Swing native-image support.

### Platform toolchains

| Platform | Required |
|----------|----------|
| **macOS** | Xcode Command Line Tools (Xcode 26 for macOS 26 appearance) |
| **Windows** | MSVC (Visual Studio Build Tools) — `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd` in CI |
| **Linux** | GCC, `patchelf`, `xvfb` (for headless compilation) |

## Build Configuration

### Gradle DSL

```kotlin
nucleus.application {
    mainClass = "com.example.MainKt"

    graalvm {
        isEnabled = true
        imageName = "my-app"

        // Gradle Java Toolchain: auto-downloads Liberica NIK 25
        // if it's not already installed on the machine.
        // In CI, the JDK is set up by graalvm/setup-graalvm@v1 instead.
        javaLanguageVersion = 25
        jvmVendor = JvmVendorSpec.BELLSOFT

        buildArgs.addAll(
            "-H:+AddAllCharsets",
            "-Djava.awt.headless=false",
            "-Os",
            "-H:-IncludeMethodData",
        )
        nativeImageConfigBaseDir.set(
            layout.projectDirectory.dir(
                when {
                    org.gradle.internal.os.OperatingSystem.current().isMacOsX ->
                        "src/main/resources-macos/META-INF/native-image"
                    org.gradle.internal.os.OperatingSystem.current().isWindows ->
                        "src/main/resources-windows/META-INF/native-image"
                    org.gradle.internal.os.OperatingSystem.current().isLinux ->
                        "src/main/resources-linux/META-INF/native-image"
                    else -> throw GradleException("Unsupported OS")
                },
            ),
        )
    }
}
```

## Reflection Configuration

This is the hardest and most critical part of native-image compilation. GraalVM performs a **closed-world analysis** — any class accessed via reflection must be declared explicitly, otherwise the application crashes at runtime.

### Step 1: Copy the pre-configured metadata

The example app ships with pre-configured `reachability-metadata.json` files for all three platforms. These cover Compose Desktop, `decorated-window-jni`, and standard AWT/Swing classes — representing hundreds of entries that would be tedious to build from scratch. **Always start from these files:**

```bash
# From the Nucleus repository
cp -r example/src/main/resources-macos   your-app/src/main/
cp -r example/src/main/resources-linux   your-app/src/main/
cp -r example/src/main/resources-windows your-app/src/main/
```

This gives you a working baseline for a basic Compose Desktop application. The next steps add entries specific to your own dependencies.

### Step 2: Run the tracing agent

Nucleus provides a Gradle task that runs your application with the GraalVM tracing agent. The agent records all reflection, JNI, resource, and proxy accesses and **merges** the results into your existing configuration (your manual entries are never overwritten):

```bash
./gradlew runWithNativeAgent
```

The goal is not to run the app for a fixed duration — it is to **trigger every code path that loads resources or uses reflection**. This is critical because Compose loads resources (images, fonts, strings) via reflection at runtime. If a resource isn't loaded during the tracing run, it won't be included in the native binary and the app will crash.

During the tracing run, make sure to:

- **Navigate to every screen** of your application
- **Toggle dark/light theme** — if your icons differ between themes, both variants must be loaded
- **Open every dialog**, menu, tooltip, and dropdown
- **Trigger all lazy-loaded content** (expand lists, scroll to bottom, etc.)
- **Exercise all features** that load resources dynamically

!!! success "SVG icons and fonts are included automatically"
    If you depend on `nucleus.graalvm-runtime`, all `.svg`, `.ttf`, and `.otf` resources on the classpath are included in the native binary automatically. You do **not** need the tracing agent to discover icon resources — they just work. See [Automatic Resource Inclusion](#automatic-resource-inclusion) for details.

!!! warning "Reflection and resource bundles still require the agent"
    While icons and fonts are covered automatically, **reflection metadata** and **resource bundles** (locale-specific `.properties` files) still require the tracing agent. During the tracing run, make sure to navigate to every screen, toggle dark/light theme, and exercise all features that use reflection or i18n.

!!! tip "Prefer Kotlin-generated icons over resource files"
    For maximum control over binary size, convert your icons to Kotlin `ImageVector` definitions (using tools like [Composables](https://composables.com/svgtocompose) or the Material Icons library). Kotlin-generated icons are compiled directly into the binary and require no reflection or resource resolution.

The agent output is automatically merged into your `nativeImageConfigBaseDir`.

### Step 3: Review and fix the configuration

The agent captures most reflection calls, but it **cannot capture code paths that weren't exercised** during the tracing run. You may need to manually add or adjust entries in `reachability-metadata.json`.

For example, the ktor networking library requires manually adding:

```json
{
    "type": "io.ktor.network.selector.InterestSuspensionsMap",
    "allDeclaredFields": true
}
```

The agent might have generated an entry for this class, but without `allDeclaredFields: true` — causing a runtime crash when ktor tries to access fields reflectively.

!!! tip "Debugging missing reflection"
    Run your native binary from the terminal. Reflection failures produce clear error messages like `Class not found` or `No such field`. Add the missing entries and recompile.

### Step 4: Repeat on each platform

The reflection configuration is **platform-specific**. Each platform uses different AWT implementations, security providers, and system classes. You need three separate configurations:

```
src/main/resources-macos/META-INF/native-image/reachability-metadata.json
src/main/resources-linux/META-INF/native-image/reachability-metadata.json
src/main/resources-windows/META-INF/native-image/reachability-metadata.json
```

Run steps 2 and 3 **on each platform separately**. The pre-configured files from step 1 already contain platform-specific entries, but your own dependencies may require additional entries that differ per OS.

## Application Bootstrap

### `graalvm-runtime` module

The `graalvm-runtime` module provides everything needed to bootstrap a Compose Desktop application in a GraalVM native image. Add it to your dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter:nucleus.graalvm-runtime:<version>")
}
```

Then call `GraalVmInitializer.initialize()` as the **first line** of your `main()` function, before any AWT or Compose usage:

```kotlin
import io.github.kdroidfilter.nucleus.graalvm.GraalVmInitializer

fun main() {
    GraalVmInitializer.initialize()

    application {
        Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication, title = "MyApp") {
            App()
        }
    }
}
```

The initializer handles all of the following automatically:

| Concern | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Metal L&F** | Sets `swing.defaultlaf` to avoid unsupported platform modules |
| **`java.home`** | Points to the executable directory so Skiko finds jawt |
| **`java.library.path`** | Sets `execDir` + `execDir/bin` so fontmanager/freetype/awt are discoverable |
| **Charset init** | Forces early `Charset.defaultCharset()` to prevent `InternalError: platform encoding not initialized` |
| **Fontmanager preload** | Calls `System.loadLibrary("fontmanager")` early to avoid crashes in `Font.createFont()` |
| **Linux HiDPI** | Detects and applies the native scale factor via [`linux-hidpi`](runtime/linux-hidpi.md) (works in both JVM and native image) |

The native-image-specific steps only run when `org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode` is set. The Linux HiDPI detection runs unconditionally (it's a no-op on non-Linux platforms).

You can also check `GraalVmInitializer.isNativeImage` at any point to branch on native-image vs JVM execution.

### Font substitutions

The module also ships GraalVM `@TargetClass` substitutions (Java source files) that fix font-related crashes in native image on Windows and Linux:

- **`FontCreateFontSubstitution`** — Buffers `Font.createFont(int, InputStream)` to a temp file on Windows, working around streams that lack mark/reset support in native image.
- **`Win32FontManagerSubstitution`** — Replaces `Win32FontManager.getFontPath()` with a pure-Java implementation, fixing `InternalError: platform encoding not initialized`.
- **`FcFontManagerSubstitution`** — Fixes `FcFontManager.getFontPath()` on Linux native image.

These substitutions are automatically picked up by the native-image compiler — no configuration needed.

### Automatic Resource Inclusion

One of the most common pitfalls with GraalVM native-image is **missing resources at runtime**. Icons, fonts, and service descriptors must be explicitly registered — otherwise `Class.getResource()` returns `null` and your UI renders blank icons.

The `graalvm-runtime` module solves this automatically. It ships a `native-image.properties` file that registers broad resource patterns at compile time:

| Pattern | What it covers |
|---------|----------------|
| `.*\.(svg\|ttf\|otf)` | All SVG icons and font files on the classpath — Jewel, IntelliJ Platform icons, Compose resources, your own icons |
| `nucleus/native/.*` | All Nucleus JNI native libraries (`.dll`, `.dylib`, `.so`) |
| `META-INF/services/.*` | All `ServiceLoader` descriptors (ktor, coil, SLF4J, etc.) |

This means:

- **All SVG icons work out of the box** — no need to run the tracing agent just to discover icons. Jewel's `PathIconKey`, `AllIconsKeys`, dark/light variants, `@2x` retina variants — everything is included automatically.
- **All fonts are embedded** — Inter, JetBrains Mono, or any custom `.ttf`/`.otf` in your dependencies.
- **Service loaders resolve correctly** — ktor engines, coil fetchers, SLF4J providers, etc.

!!! note "Binary size trade-off"
    The glob pattern `.*\.(svg|ttf|otf)` includes **all** SVGs and fonts from **all** JARs on the classpath. If you depend on the IntelliJ Platform icons library, this may add several megabytes of icons you don't actually use. For most applications, the convenience far outweighs the size increase. If binary size is critical, you can override with more targeted patterns in your own `resource-config.json`.

!!! tip "What still needs the tracing agent?"
    The automatic resource patterns cover icons, fonts, native libraries, and service loaders. You **still** need the tracing agent (`runWithNativeAgent`) for:

    - **Reflection metadata** — classes accessed via `Class.forName()`, `getDeclaredField()`, etc.
    - **JNI metadata** — native methods accessed from C/C++ code
    - **Resource bundles** — locale-specific `.properties` files (AWT, Swing, Jewel i18n bundles)
    - **Non-standard resources** — `.sha256` checksums, `.class` files, `.properties` files, ICU data

### Decorated Window

The [`decorated-window-jni`](runtime/decorated-window.md) module was specifically designed to work with GraalVM Native Image (no JBR dependency). Use it instead of `decorated-window-jbr` for native-image builds.

## Gradle Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `runWithNativeAgent` | Run the app with the GraalVM tracing agent to collect reflection metadata |
| `packageGraalvmNative` | Compile and package the application as a native binary |
| `runGraalvmNative` | Build and run the native image directly |
| `packageGraalvmDeb` | Package the native image as a `.deb` installer (Linux) |
| `packageGraalvmDmg` | Package the native image as a `.dmg` installer (macOS) |
| `packageGraalvmNsis` | Package the native image as an NSIS `.exe` installer (Windows) |

```bash
# Collect reflection metadata (run on each platform)
./gradlew runWithNativeAgent

# Build the raw native image
./gradlew packageGraalvmNative

# Build and run the native image
./gradlew runGraalvmNative

# Build platform-specific installers (requires Node.js for electron-builder)
./gradlew packageGraalvmDeb    # Linux
./gradlew packageGraalvmDmg    # macOS
./gradlew packageGraalvmNsis   # Windows

# NOTE: The `homepage` property is required in nativeDistributions for DEB packaging.
# electron-builder will fail without it. See Configuration > Package Metadata.
```

Use `-PnativeMarch=compatibility` for binaries that should run on older CPUs:

```bash
./gradlew packageGraalvmNative -PnativeMarch=compatibility
```

### Output location

The raw native binary and its companion shared libraries are generated in:

```
<project>/build/compose/tmp/<project>/graalvm/output/
```

| Platform | Output |
|----------|--------|
| **macOS** | `output/MyApp.app/` (full `.app` bundle with `Info.plist`, icons, signed dylibs) |
| **Windows** | `output/my-app.exe` + companion DLLs (`awt.dll`, `fontmanager.dll`, etc.) |
| **Linux** | `output/my-app` + companion `.so` files (`libawt.so`, `libfontmanager.so`, etc.) |

The `packageGraalvm<Format>` tasks produce installers in:

```
<project>/build/compose/binaries/<buildType>/graalvm-<format>/
```

## CI/CD

Native image compilation must happen **on each target platform**. Use `setup-nucleus` with `graalvm: 'true'`:

```

See [CI/CD](ci-cd.md#graalvm-native-image-release) for the full release workflow with publishing to GitHub Releases.

## No Release Build Type

Unlike standard JVM builds, GraalVM native-image builds **do not have a release variant**. There is no `packageReleaseGraalvmNative` or `runReleaseGraalvmNative` task. This is intentional:

- **ProGuard is redundant** — GraalVM native-image already performs closed-world dead code elimination at compile time. Running ProGuard beforehand provides no additional size benefit.
- **ProGuard is harmful** — ProGuard can rename or remove classes that are referenced in `reachability-metadata.json`, causing runtime crashes. Maintaining both ProGuard keep rules and reflection metadata is error-prone.

All GraalVM tasks use the default (non-ProGuard) build type. Use `-Os` in `buildArgs` for size optimization.

## Best Practices

### Avoid reflection-heavy libraries

Every library that uses reflection needs manual configuration. Prefer libraries that work without reflection (compile-time code generation, direct method calls). If you must use reflection-heavy libraries (ktor, serialization), expect to spend significant time on configuration.

### Test on all platforms early

Don't wait until the end to test native-image on all three platforms. Each platform has its own set of reflection requirements and quirks. Test early and often.

### Use the Jewel sample as reference

The [`jewel-sample`](https://github.com/kdroidFilter/Nucleus/tree/main/jewel-sample) in the Nucleus repository demonstrates a more complex native-image setup with the Jewel UI library, including custom font resolution patches for Windows and extensive reflection configuration. It is an excellent reference for advanced use cases.

## Future: Automatic Reflection Resolution Plugin

!!! tip "Looking for sponsors"

The biggest pain point of GraalVM Native Image is **reflection configuration**. Today, you must run the tracing agent, manually review the output, and repeat for every dependency and every platform. This is tedious, error-prone, and the primary reason native-image remains "experimental" for most developers.

**It is technically feasible to build a Gradle plugin that would automatically resolve nearly all reflection requirements** for a Compose Desktop application. Such a plugin would:

- Analyze the classpath at build time and generate reflection/JNI/resource metadata automatically
- Cover Compose, AWT/Swing, Skiko, and common libraries (ktor, kotlinx.serialization, coil, etc.)
- Report libraries for which it could not resolve reflection, so the developer knows exactly what needs manual attention
- Dramatically lower the barrier to entry for native-image builds

This would be a **game changer for the Compose Desktop ecosystem** — it would make GraalVM Native Image practical not just for small utilities but for large, real-world applications that need the JVM ecosystem's libraries while benefiting from native startup, low memory, and small bundle size.

However, building this plugin represents a **massive engineering effort** (deep analysis of bytecode, annotation processing, library-specific heuristics, cross-platform testing). This is far beyond what can be done in spare time.
