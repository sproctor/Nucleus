# LLM Documentation

Nucleus provides machine-readable documentation files designed for Large Language Models (LLMs). These plain-text files follow the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) convention and allow AI assistants to quickly understand the project, its APIs, and configuration options.

## Available Files

| File | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| [`llms.txt`](../llms.txt) | Concise overview (~130 lines) | Quick context for simple questions |
| [`llms-full.txt`](../llms-full.txt) | Complete documentation (~900 lines) | Full reference for code generation and in-depth tasks |

## Usage

### ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.

Paste the URL directly in your prompt:

```
Read https://nucleus.kdroidfilter.com/llms-full.txt and help me configure
a Nucleus project with NSIS installer, auto-update, and macOS signing.
```

### Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code

Add the URL as a documentation source in your AI-powered IDE, or reference it in your project instructions:

```
@doc https://nucleus.kdroidfilter.com/llms-full.txt
```

### Custom Agents / RAG Pipelines
