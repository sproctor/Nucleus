# Decorated Window

Compose for Desktop does not allow drawing custom content in the title bar while keeping native window controls and native behavior (drag, resize, double-click maximize). You must choose between a native title bar you cannot customize, or a fully undecorated window where you reimplement everything from scratch.

The decorated window modules bridge this gap. They are a fork of [Jewel](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/platform/jewel)'s decorated window, **without any dependency on Jewel itself**. Key differences from Jewel:

- **No JNA** — all native calls use JNI only, removing the JNA dependency entirely
- **Design-system agnostic** — no Material dependency; easily map any theme (Material 3, Jewel, your own) to its styling tokens
- **`DecoratedDialog`** — custom title bar for dialog windows, which Jewel does not provide
- **Reworked Linux rendering** — the entire Linux experience has been rebuilt from the ground up to look as native as possible, even though everything is drawn with Compose: platform-accurate GNOME Adwaita and KDE Breeze window controls, proper window shape clipping, border styling, and full behavior emulation (drag, double-click maximize, focus-aware button states)

## Module Structure

The decorated window functionality is split into three modules:

| Module | Artifact | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `decorated-window-core` | `nucleus.decorated-window-core` | Shared types, layout, styling, resources. No platform-specific code. |
| `decorated-window-jbr` | `nucleus.decorated-window-jbr` | JBR-based implementation. Uses JetBrains Runtime's `CustomTitleBar` API on macOS and Windows. |
| `decorated-window-jni` | `nucleus.decorated-window-jni` | JBR-free implementation. Uses JNI native libraries on all platforms, with pure-Compose fallbacks when native libs are unavailable. |

Both `decorated-window-jbr` and `decorated-window-jni` expose **the same public API**. Choose the one that fits your runtime:

### `decorated-window-jbr` — JetBrains Runtime implementation

Uses JetBrains' official `CustomTitleBar` API. This is the more **battle-tested** option, backed by the same code that powers IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains products. Requires JBR.

However, there are a few known issues on **Windows**:

- The window **cannot open in maximized state** directly — you need to use a `LaunchedEffect` with a short delay after the window appears, then set `WindowPlacement.Maximized`
- Title bar drag events are **occasionally missed**, causing the window to not follow the cursor during drag

These are upstream JBR bugs, not Nucleus bugs. The module throws an `IllegalStateException` at startup if JBR is not detected.

!!! tip
    When running via `./gradlew run`, Gradle uses the JDK configured in your toolchain. Make sure it is a JBR distribution if using this module.

### `decorated-window-jni` — Nucleus native implementation

Entirely implemented by Nucleus using JNI native libraries on all platforms. None of the JBR bugs mentioned above are present — window maximization and drag work reliably.

This module does not depend on JBR, making it compatible with **any JVM** (OpenJDK, GraalVM Native Image, etc.). It was specifically designed for use cases where JBR is not available, such as GraalVM native-image builds. On Linux, pair it with [`linux-hidpi`](linux-hidpi.md) for correct HiDPI support.

!!! warning "macOS: requires a JDK compiled with Xcode 26"
    The macOS native library (`libnucleus_macos_jni.dylib`) must be compiled with **Xcode 26** or later. This means the JDK you use to run your application must also have been built with Xcode 26. JDKs built with older Xcode versions will fail to load the native library at runtime, and the module will fall back to AWT client properties (no custom title bar positioning, no traffic light control).

!!! note "Windows: no white background flash during resize"
    On Windows, Skiko's rendering pipeline clears the DirectX canvas to white before each frame. When the window is resized larger, the newly exposed pixels remain white for one frame — producing a visible white flash. The JNI module eliminates this by adjusting Skiko's clear color to transparent for dark themes (rendered as opaque black on the DirectX surface), so the flash is invisible against a dark background. It also synchronizes the DWM caption and border colors (`DWMWA_CAPTION_COLOR`, `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR`, `DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE`) with the title bar color for consistent Windows 11 window chrome styling.

    This fix is **not present** in `decorated-window-jbr`.

!!! warning "Less battle-tested"
    While the JNI module has no known bugs, it has not been as widely tested as the JBR implementation. Use it with appropriate caution in production, and report any issues you encounter.

## Installation

Choose one implementation:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Option 1: JBR-based (requires JetBrains Runtime)
    implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter:nucleus.decorated-window-jbr:<version>")

    // Option 2: JNI-based (works on any JVM)
    implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter:nucleus.decorated-window-jni:<version>")
}
```

If you use Material 3, add the companion module:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter:nucleus.decorated-window-material:<version>")
}
```

!!! note
    See [`decorated-window-material`](decorated-window-material.md) for automatic `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` wiring.

## Quick Start

```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    NucleusDecoratedWindowTheme(isDark = true) {
        DecoratedWindow(
            onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication,
            title = "My App",
        ) {
            TitleBar { state ->
                Text(
                    title,
                    modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally),
                    color = LocalContentColor.current,
                )
            }
            // Your app content
            MyContent()
        }
    }
}
```

## Platform Behavior

### JBR module (`decorated-window-jbr`)

|  | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|-------|---------|-------|
| Decoration | JBR `CustomTitleBar` | JBR `CustomTitleBar` | Fully undecorated |
| Window controls | Native traffic lights | Native min/max/close | Compose `WindowControlArea` (SVG icons) |
| Drag | JBR hit-test | JBR `forceHitTest` | `JBR.getWindowMove().startMovingTogetherWithMouse()` |
| Double-click maximize | Native | Native | Manual detection |
| RTL support | No (requires [custom JBR](../targets/macos.md#jvm-based-applications) for hot-swap) | Yes (no hot-swap, restart required) | Yes (hot-swap) |

### JNI module (`decorated-window-jni`)

|  | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|-------|---------|-------|
| Decoration | JNI native bridge | JNI DLL (WndProc subclass) | JNI .so (`_NET_WM_MOVERESIZE`) |
| Window controls | Native traffic lights | Compose `WindowsWindowControlArea` (SVG icons) | Compose `WindowControlArea` (SVG icons) |
| Drag | `nativeStartWindowDrag()` via JNI | Native DLL or Compose fallback | `_NET_WM_MOVERESIZE` or Compose fallback |
| Double-click maximize | Native via JNI | Native or Compose detection | Compose detection |
| Fallback (no native lib) | AWT client properties | Compose `windowDragHandler()` | Compose `windowDragHandler()` |
| RTL support | Yes (live hot-swap) | Yes (live hot-swap) | Yes (hot-swap) |

On **macOS**, both modules preserve the native traffic lights.

On **Windows**, the JBR module uses the native min/max/close buttons, while the JNI module draws its own window controls with Compose (SVG icons matching the Windows style).

On **Linux**, the window is fully undecorated in both modules. They render their own close/minimize/maximize buttons using SVG icons adapted to the desktop environment (GNOME Adwaita or KDE Breeze). The window shape is also clipped to rounded corners to match the native look.

## Components

### `NucleusDecoratedWindowTheme`

Provides styling for all decorated window components via `CompositionLocal`. Must wrap `DecoratedWindow` / `DecoratedDialog`.

```kotlin
NucleusDecoratedWindowTheme(
    isDark: Boolean = true,
    windowStyle: DecoratedWindowStyle = DecoratedWindowDefaults.dark/lightWindowStyle(),
    titleBarStyle: TitleBarStyle = DecoratedWindowDefaults.dark/lightTitleBarStyle(),
) {
    // DecoratedWindow / DecoratedDialog go here
}
```

The `isDark` flag selects the built-in dark or light presets. Pass your own `windowStyle` / `titleBarStyle` to override any or all values.

### `DecoratedWindow`

Drop-in replacement for Compose `Window()`. Manages window state (active, fullscreen, minimized, maximized) and platform-specific decorations.

```kotlin
DecoratedWindow(
    onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication,
    state = rememberWindowState(),
    title = "My App",
    icon = null,
    resizable = true,
) {
    TitleBar { state -> /* title bar content */ }
    // window content
}
```

The `content` lambda receives a `DecoratedWindowScope` which exposes:

- `window: ComposeWindow` — the underlying AWT window
- `state: DecoratedWindowState` — current window state (`.isActive`, `.isFullscreen`, `.isMinimized`, `.isMaximized`)

### `DecoratedDialog`

Same concept for dialog windows. Uses `DialogWindow` internally. Dialogs only show a close button on Linux (no minimize/maximize).

```kotlin
DecoratedDialog(
    onCloseRequest = { showDialog = false },
    title = "Settings",
    resizable = false,
) {
    DialogTitleBar { state ->
        Text(title, modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally))
    }
    // dialog content
}
```

### `TitleBar` / `DialogTitleBar`

Platform-dispatched title bar composable. Provides a `TitleBarScope` with:

- `title: String` — the window title passed to `DecoratedWindow`
- `icon: Painter?` — the window icon
- `Modifier.align(alignment: Alignment.Horizontal)` — positions content within the title bar

```kotlin
TitleBar { state ->
    // Left-aligned icon
    Icon(
        painter = myIcon,
        contentDescription = null,
        modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Start),
    )

    // Centered title
    Text(
        title,
        modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally),
        color = LocalContentColor.current,
    )

    // Right-aligned action
    IconButton(
        onClick = { /* ... */ },
        modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.End),
    ) {
        Icon(Icons.Default.Settings, contentDescription = "Settings")
    }
}
```

Centered content is automatically shifted to avoid overlapping with start/end content.

## Styling

### Mapping Your Own Theme

The key idea: `NucleusDecoratedWindowTheme` accepts two style objects. You build them from whatever color system you use:

```kotlin
// Example: map a custom theme to decorated window styles
val myWindowStyle = DecoratedWindowStyle(
    colors = DecoratedWindowColors(
        border = MyTheme.colors.border,
        borderInactive = MyTheme.colors.border.copy(alpha = 0.5f),
    ),
    metrics = DecoratedWindowMetrics(borderWidth = 1.dp),
)

val myTitleBarStyle = TitleBarStyle(
    colors = TitleBarColors(
        background = MyTheme.colors.surface,
        inactiveBackground = MyTheme.colors.surfaceDim,
        content = MyTheme.colors.onSurface,
        border = MyTheme.colors.outline,
    ),
    metrics = TitleBarMetrics(height = 40.dp),
    icons = TitleBarIcons(), // null = use platform defaults
)

NucleusDecoratedWindowTheme(
    isDark = MyTheme.isDark,
    windowStyle = myWindowStyle,
    titleBarStyle = myTitleBarStyle,
) {
    DecoratedWindow(...) { ... }
}
```

### `DecoratedWindowStyle`

Controls the window border (visible only on Linux):

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `colors.border` | Border color when window is active |
| `colors.borderInactive` | Border color when window is inactive |
| `metrics.borderWidth` | Border width (default 1.dp) |

### `TitleBarStyle`

Controls the title bar appearance:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `colors.background` | Title bar background when active |
| `colors.inactiveBackground` | Title bar background when inactive |
| `colors.content` | Default content color (exposed via `LocalContentColor`) |
| `colors.border` | Bottom border of the title bar |
| `colors.fullscreenControlButtonsBackground` | Background for macOS fullscreen traffic lights |
| `colors.iconButtonHoveredBackground` | Background for icon buttons on hover |
| `colors.iconButtonPressedBackground` | Background for icon buttons on press |
| `metrics.height` | Title bar height (default 40.dp) |
| `metrics.gradientStartX` / `gradientEndX` | Gradient range (see below) |
| `icons` | Custom `Painter` for close/minimize/maximize/restore buttons (null = platform default) |

## Gradient

The `TitleBar` composable accepts a `gradientStartColor` parameter. When set, the title bar background becomes a horizontal gradient that transitions from the `background` color through `gradientStartColor` and back to `background`:

```
[background] → [gradientStartColor] → [background]
```

The gradient range is controlled by `TitleBarMetrics.gradientStartX` and `gradientEndX`.

```kotlin
TitleBar(
    gradientStartColor = Color(0xFF6200EE),
) { state ->
    Text(title, modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally))
}
```

When `gradientStartColor` is `Color.Unspecified` (the default), the background is a solid color.

## Fullscreen Title Bar

### `newFullscreenControls()` — Sliding Overlay Title Bar

The `newFullscreenControls()` modifier enables a **native-style sliding title bar** in fullscreen mode. When the window enters fullscreen, the title bar is hidden and rendered as a **floating overlay** that slides down when the user moves the pointer near the top edge of the screen, and slides back up when the pointer moves away.

The behavior matches each platform's native fullscreen conventions: **Safari-like** on macOS, **Edge-like** on Windows, and **Firefox-like** on Linux.

This works on **all three platforms** (macOS, Windows, Linux).

!!! note "Windows fullscreen fix"
    Compose for Desktop does not handle fullscreen correctly on Windows — the window does not cover the taskbar and does not behave like a true fullscreen window. With `newFullscreenControls()` and `decorated-window-jni`, fullscreen is implemented via native Win32 APIs, producing a true fullscreen window that covers the taskbar, exactly like Edge or other native Windows applications.

```kotlin
TitleBar(modifier = Modifier.newFullscreenControls()) { state ->
    // ...
}
```

#### Behavior

- In windowed mode, the title bar behaves normally
- When the window enters fullscreen:
    - The title bar is removed from the window layout and repositioned as a **top-edge overlay**
    - Moving the pointer to the top edge of the screen triggers a **200ms slide-down animation**
    - Moving the pointer away triggers a **200ms slide-up animation** (hidden)
    - The title bar content, window controls, and drag behavior are preserved in the overlay

#### Platform details

| Platform | Fullscreen trigger | Overlay behavior |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **macOS** | Native macOS fullscreen (green traffic light) | Safari-like: synced with the system menu bar; traffic light buttons animate in/out together with the title bar. Uses a native `NSEvent` monitor for menu bar visibility detection. |
| **Windows** | Native Win32 fullscreen | Edge-like: title bar overlay with Compose-drawn window controls (minimize, maximize, close). Supports both native JNI drag and Compose fallback. |
| **Linux** | Native WM fullscreen | Firefox-like: title bar overlay with GNOME Adwaita or KDE Breeze window controls. Uses `_NET_WM_MOVERESIZE` or Compose fallback for drag. |

With `decorated-window-jbr`, this modifier sets the `apple.awt.newFullScreenControls` system property on macOS and uses `fullscreenControlButtonsBackground` from your `TitleBarStyle`. The sliding overlay behavior is only available with `decorated-window-jni`.

With `decorated-window-jni`, the full sliding overlay is available on all platforms.

### `macOSLargeCornerRadius()` — Large Corner Radius

On macOS, use the `macOSLargeCornerRadius()` modifier on `TitleBar` to enable the 26pt window corner radius — the same radius used by Apple apps with a toolbar (Finder, Safari, etc.). Without this modifier, the window uses the standard ~10pt radius.

```kotlin
TitleBar(
    modifier = Modifier
        .newFullscreenControls()
        .macOSLargeCornerRadius()
) { state ->
    // ...
}
```

When enabled, an invisible `NSToolbar` is attached to the window, which triggers AppKit's larger corner radius. The traffic light buttons are automatically repositioned to match Apple's native inset (+6pt horizontally and vertically), consistent with Finder and Safari.

The toolbar is transparently managed around fullscreen transitions — removed before entering fullscreen to avoid visual glitches, and reinstalled after the animation completes.

!!! warning "Requires a JDK compiled with Xcode 26"
    This modifier relies on the JNI native library to install the `NSToolbar`. If the native library cannot be loaded (i.e. the JDK was not compiled with Xcode 26 or later), `macOSLargeCornerRadius()` has **no effect**: the window will keep the standard ~10pt corner radius, and the traffic light buttons will remain at their default (smaller) position.

This modifier only has an effect with `decorated-window-jni` on macOS. It is safe to call on other platforms (no-op).

## ProGuard

Both modules use JNI on macOS. When ProGuard is enabled, the native bridge classes must be preserved. The Nucleus Gradle plugin includes these rules automatically, but if you need to add them manually:

```proguard
# Nucleus decorated-window-jbr JNI
-keep class io.github.kdroidfilter.nucleus.window.utils.macos.NativeMacBridge {
    native <methods>;
}

# Nucleus decorated-window-jni JNI (all platforms)
-keep class io.github.kdroidfilter.nucleus.window.utils.macos.JniMacTitleBarBridge {
    native <methods>;
}
-keep class io.github.kdroidfilter.nucleus.window.utils.windows.JniWindowsDecorationBridge {
    native <methods>;
}
-keep class io.github.kdroidfilter.nucleus.window.utils.linux.JniLinuxWindowBridge {
    native <methods>;
}

-keep class io.github.kdroidfilter.nucleus.window.** { *; }
```

## RTL (Right-to-Left) Layout Support

### Windows

Both modules support RTL layout on Windows, but they differ in how they handle runtime direction changes:

- **`decorated-window-jbr`**: Supports RTL layout, but **does not support hot-swapping** between RTL and LTR at runtime. If your application needs to switch layout direction, the user must **restart the application** for the change to take effect.
- **`decorated-window-jni`**: Supports RTL layout with **live hot-swapping** — the title bar and window controls update immediately when the layout direction changes at runtime, with no restart required.

### macOS

The standard JetBrains Runtime **does not support RTL** for the title bar on macOS — the traffic lights and title bar layout always remain in LTR mode.

Two options are available for RTL support on macOS:

- **`decorated-window-jni`**: Fully supports RTL layout with **live hot-swapping**, no custom JDK required.
- **`decorated-window-jbr`** with the [custom JBR fork](../targets/macos.md#jvm-based-applications) (`v25.0.2b329.66-rtl`): Supports RTL layout with **live hot-swapping** as well. This fork includes a native RTL fix for macOS window decorations.

### Linux

RTL layout is handled entirely by Compose since the window is fully undecorated on Linux. Both modules support RTL with live hot-swapping.

## Linux Desktop Environment Detection

On Linux, the module detects the current desktop environment and loads the appropriate icon set:

- **GNOME** — Adwaita-style icons, rounded top corners (12dp radius)
- **KDE** — Breeze-style icons, rounded top corners (5dp radius)
- **Other** — Falls back to GNOME style

Detection uses `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` and `DESKTOP_SESSION` environment variables.
