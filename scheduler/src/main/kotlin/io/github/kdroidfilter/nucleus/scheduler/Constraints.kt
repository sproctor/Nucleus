/**
 * Describes conditions that must be met before a scheduled task executes.
 *
 * Constraints are checked at execution time by [DesktopBootReceiver] — the OS
 * still triggers the process on schedule, but `doWork()` is only called when
 * all constraints are satisfied.
 *
 * When constraints are not met:
 * - **Periodic tasks**: the execution is silently skipped; the next trigger re-checks.
 * - **Calendar / on-boot tasks**: a retry is scheduled with backoff.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * TaskRequest.periodic("sync", 2.hours) {
 *     constraints {
 *         requiredNetworkType = NetworkType.UNMETERED
 *         requiresBatteryNotLow = true
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
